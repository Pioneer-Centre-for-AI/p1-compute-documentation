The P1 DTU HPC is hosted at DTU and provides high-performance computing resources for P1 members (PhD and above). It is particularly suitable for medium to large-scale machine learning experiments and research projects.


## Getting Access

**Requirements:** PhD or higher (exceptions may apply), valid Danish university email, and registered P1 affiliation.

<Steps class="space-y-6">
1. <EmbedForm title="P1 Affiliation Form" src="https://da.surveymonkey.com/r/P1Affiliation" minHeight="1200px" class="my-2" /> Before accessing the P1 DTU HPC, you must first [register to become a member of P1](https://www.aicentre.dk/affiliation).
2. <EmbedForm title="P1 HPC Access Exception Form" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciaOm-CYwl48LGGZC7qlmCSPU7kfEitjGy4kvZXAXEPbo_eA/viewform?embedded=true" minHeight="1200px" class="my-2" /> **PhD P1 affiliates and above can skip this step.** If you are a P1 member currently enrolled in a MSc, research assistant (RA) role, or similar,
then you are not eligible for access without a written approval of exception from a responsible
person (a P1 co-lead or faculty member) who can vouch for your request. Please fill in the following form
and have the responsible person send a confirmation to the governance mail at
[compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk](mailto:compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk)
so they can audit the request.
3. <EmbedForm title="DTU Account Signup Form" src="https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=I_FR8s7JjkSSdzS7KFkR2TcQSfcccxdDtaq8HEbAO1RUQjZUUEoxSlRCRk5KV09WSlRZNjNLVE1KRi4u" height="800px" /> Fill out the DTU account request form below. Only signup using an official university email address is accepted. The form will be processed by Henning Christiansen, head of DTU's compute center and you will receive account details via email once created.
</Steps>

## Connecting to the Cluster

The compute cluster is accessible at `login9.hpc.dtu.dk` via SSH. Note that:

- Home directories have limited storage (30GB)
- Additional storage is available at `/dtu/p1/`
- Interactive node is available for package installation and test runs
- Heavy jobs should be submitted as batch jobs

### Access from Outside DTU Network

<Steps>

1. Download Cisco AnyConnect VPN client (see OpenConnect for Linux)
2. Go to https://dtubasen.dtu.dk and sign in via Azure multi-factor auth using your full DTU username
3. Set up multi-factor authentication
4. Connect to vpn.dtu.dk using AnyConnect
5. SSH to `login9.hpc.dtu.dk` using your DTU credentials

</Steps>

For persistent access, you can set up SSH keys:

<Steps>

1. Generate key

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/keyname
    ```

2. Copy public key

    ```
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/keyname.pub username@login9.hpc.dtu.dk
    ```

3. Connect

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/keyname username@login9.hpc.dtu.dk
    ```

</Steps>

TIP: Consider setting up a SSH host alias for `login9.hpc.dtu.dk` in your `~/.ssh/config` file to make it easier to connect to the cluster.

## Fair Use Policy

The following rules are in place to ensure fair use of the P1 DTU HPC:

- Maximum wall time: 72 hours
- Maximum number of GPUs in a job: 2 (one node)
- Maximum running jobs: ~50% of total available GPUs
- 500 gb of storage (+30gb in home directory)

If you have a project that requires more storage resources than the above, please contact the governance group [compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk](mailto:compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk) to discuss your needs.

<Aside type="caution" title="GDPR Compliance">
The P1 DTU HPC is only intended for non-GDPR data e.g. public datasets, open benchmarks, etc. To be more
specific, you can still work on private datasets because your home directory is not shared with other users, but
data is not encrypted in a way to be GDPR compliant. For GDPR-compliant data processing, please refer to the P1 NGC HPC.
