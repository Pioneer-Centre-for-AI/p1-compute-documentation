The compute landscape can be complex, and we know it’s not always easy for researchers to find the right resources. While Denmark offers a wide range of HPC options, we don’t aim to cover them all here. Instead, as part of the P1 consortium, we focus on collaborating with a select group of HPC facilities and operate our own systems in partnership with P1 partner universities - tailored specifically to support P1-affiliated research.

We recommend starting by reaching out to your local institution to explore what’s available and whether it fits your needs. Before diving into the P1 compute resources, please take a moment to review our guides - they’ll help ensure your projects are set up for compatibility and held to a higher standard.

      The [P1 DTU HPC](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/) cluster is designed for general research workloads. It provides free compute and storage resources for P1 affiliated researchers, making it ideal for a wide range of academic and scientific projects. This cluster is not GDPR-compliant and is best suited for non-sensitive data and standard research tasks.

      The [P1 NGC HPC](https://www.ngc.dk/infrastrukturen-for-personlig-medicin/supercomputer) provides a GDPR-compliant computing environment with free compute and storage resources for P1 affiliated researchers. It is specifically designed for projects that require handling of sensitive or personal data, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations while supporting advanced research needs.

  <Card title="Intended Use" icon="approve-check">
    <p>Our compute clusters are primarily for research projects. Commercial use is generally not permitted on the P1 DTU and NGC HPCs; however, Gefion may accommodate certain commercial research projects on a case-by-case basis.</p>
  </Card>

  <Card title="Resource Policy" icon="seti:license">
    <p>Resources are limited and prioritized for P1 members at the PhD, postdoc, and faculty levels. We are committed to open access and strive to serve as many P1 members as possible. For very large-scale projects, we encourage you to reach out to discuss potential solutions.</p>

  <Card title="Detailed Cluster Information" icon="information">
    <p>Each cluster is hosted at a separate institution and managed by its own administrators. This site provides an overview and a starting point for accessing P1 compute resources. For the most up-to-date technical details, please refer to the respective cluster websites and support channels.</p>
