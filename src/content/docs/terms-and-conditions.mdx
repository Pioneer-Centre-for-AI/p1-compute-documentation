# Access and Responsibility

P1 does not directly operate the compute resources, as these are managed by the respective institutions. However, P1 provides guidance and support for using these resources and works closely with the institutions to ensure they meet the needs of P1-affiliated researchers.

# User Revision Policy

User accounts are reviewed every 6 months. The HPC governance board receives a list of all current accounts and decides which ones should remain active.

During each review, users receive an email asking them to:
- Confirm they are still actively using the cluster
- Provide a brief explanation of their current research activities

Users who either fail to respond or are not approved by the governance board will have their account placed in a 6-month grace period.

# Data Retention Policy

Once an account enters the grace period, the user's data is moved to a temporary storage location, where it will remain for the duration of the grace period (6 months, until the next review cycle). This allows for recovery or changes in data ownership.

**Data Recovery Process:**
- Users can request data recovery during the grace period by contacting the HPC governance board
- Data ownership can be transferred to another approved user during this time
- After the grace period ends, all data in temporary storage will be permanently deleted

**Important:** Users should ensure they have backed up any important data before or during the grace period, as data recovery after the grace period is not possible.
