# Terms of Use and Guidance

## Fair Use Policy

The following rules are in place to ensure fair use of the P1 DTU HPC:

- maximum wall time: 72 hours
- maximum amount of nodes/GPU's used: 50% of the available resources
- 500 gb of storage (+30gb in home directory)

If you have a project that requires more resources than the above, please contact the governance group
<compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk> to discuss your needs.

!!! warning
The P1 DTU HPC is only intended for non-GDPR data e.g. public datasets, open benchmarks, etc. To be more
specific, you can still work on private datasets because your home directory is not shared with other users, but
data is not encrypted in a way to be GDPR compliant. For GDPR-compliant data processing, please use the P1 NGC HPC.

## Investing Your Compute Budget

If you have compute funding or are applying for compute funding, you are very welcome to contact [P1's compute coordinator](https://www.aicentre.dk/computing) for a consultation.

Generally, P1 can help purchasing hardware for you if it is to be a part of P1's clusters. In this setup you would have priority access to the hardware that you purchase, but if it is unused other researchers at P1 can use it as well. Most HPC hardware has an expected utilization time of approximately 5 years.

An example of a compute budget expenditure - a researcher might have 400k DKK for non-GDPR computing. In that case P1 can purchase a 2xA100 node, with the researcher getting priority access. With the last 100k DKK, we recommend a diversification of the researchers compute portfolio.

Using some of the 100k for personal computers with powerful GPU's
and reserving a significant portion of funds for later. This could be for storage or cloud compute. Having the budget to spring for cloud compute if peak pressure on other computing resources makes training a model in time for a submission deadline infeasible can be necessary.
