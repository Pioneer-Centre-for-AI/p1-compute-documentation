Welcome to P1

Find your buddy


Find your compute resources outside P1 in :doc:`compute-resources`. Being aware of these installations is important as P1 does not have the budget to scale our compute infinitely.
We want you to apply to as many of these installations as soon as possible to ensure that you have the necessary compute hours allocated elsewhere for when our own compute resources are under peak pressure.
