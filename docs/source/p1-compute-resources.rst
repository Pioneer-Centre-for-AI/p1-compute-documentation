P1-Owned Compute Resources
##########################
In this section you will find an overview of various compute resources available to P1, but not owned by P1. We will also describe each installation, how to get access and how to use it.

Investing Your Compute Budget
*****************************
If you have compute funding or are applying for compute funding, you are very welcome to contact P1's compute coordinator for a consultation.

Generally, P1 can help purchasing hardware for you if it is to be a part of P1's clusters. In this setup you would have priority access to the hardware that you purchase, but if it is unused other researchers at P1 can use it as well. 
Most HPC hardware has an expected utilization time of approximately 5 years.

An example of a compute budget expenditure - a researcher might have 400k DKK for non-GDPR computing. In that case P1 can purchase a 2xA100 node, with the researcher getting priority access. With the last 100k DKK, we recommend a diversification of the researchers compute portfolio. Using some of the 100k for personal computers with powerful GPU's and reserving a siginificant portion of funds for later. This could be for storage or cloud compute. Having the budget to spring for cloud compute if peak pressure on other computing resources makes training a model in time for a submission deadline infeasible can be necessary.
