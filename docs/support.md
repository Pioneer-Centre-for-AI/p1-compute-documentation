# Support

In general the P1 does not have official support staff. Instead we rely on the community to help each other. However,
for questions regarding the cluster, we have the following two contact e-mails:

* For technical issues, like broken or missing packages, contact <support@hpc.dtu.dk> 

* For policy issues, like priority access, queuing system etc. contact <compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk>

If your submission to join the cluster has been pending for more than a week, you can contact the member of the P1 HPC 
committee of your institution. General announcments regarding the cluster will be made in the `#compute` channel on the 
official P1-slack. Simiarly if you have general questions regarding compute, including using the P1-cluster, feel free 
to post those questions in the `#ask-compute` channel.
