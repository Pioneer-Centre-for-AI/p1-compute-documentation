# Support

In general the P1 does not have official support staff. Instead we rely on the community to help each other. However,
for questions regarding the clusters, we have the following contact points:

## Technical Support

- **P1 DTU HPC:** For technical issues, like broken or missing packages, contact <support@hpc.dtu.dk>
- **P1 NGC HPC:** For technical issues, contact the NGC support, contact <support@ngc.dk>
- **P1 Gefion HPC:** For technical issues, contact the [Compute Coordinator](mailto:bstja@dtu.dk)

## Policy and Access Support

- For policy issues, like priority access, queuing system etc. contact <compute-governance-p1@aicentre.dk>

If your submission to join any of the clusters has been pending for more than a week, you can contact the member of the P1 HPC
committee of your institution. General announcements regarding the clusters will be made in the `#compute` channel on the
official P1-slack. Similarly if you have general questions regarding compute, including using the P1-clusters, feel free
to post those questions in the `#ask-compute` channel or contact the [Compute Coordinator](mailto:bstja@dtu.dk).
